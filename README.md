Spending nature of men Vs women<br>
Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores from the United States. Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide.<br>
Here we are analysing the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. We are trying to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men?
